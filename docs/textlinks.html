<h3>Description</h3>

<p><em>Easy Text Links</em> is a modern plugin to help you make extra
revenue from your blog by selling text links. Text link advertising can be
significantly more lucrative than contextual ads. This plugin automates
the insertion and expiration of the links, and helps you with quick
reminder emails to your advertisers.</p>

<p>Other plugins that do similar text link advertising do exist in the
repository, but they are typically front ends to services that provide
such links (such as Text Link Ads, for instance.) They take a significant
cut of your advertising revenue (50% in the case of Text Link Ads) acting
as the middlemen between you and your advertisers. <em>Easy Text
Links</em>, on the other hand, is for those who want to interact directly
with their advertisers, and keep the whole revenue for themselves, cutting
the middlemen.</p>

<p><em>Easy Text Links</em> keeps track of the expiry dates of the text
links on your page, and removes them when expired. It also gives you easy
means of sending a reminder email to the advertiser, block or delete the
links all from your blog page itself, without having to go to the admin
page. Of course, it is smart and secure so that only the blog admin with
the right privileges will ever see the options to modify the links. It
does all this magic using a modern AJAX/jQuery framework with an
attractive lightbox effect.</p>

<p>If you have a popular blog, text links can potentially bring in much
more revenue than any contextual advertising. In my case, the difference
was easily a factor of 100. Keep in mind, however, that most contextual ad
providers (such as AdSense) do not like paid link placement, for obvious
reasons. Your blog may get penalized in terms page rank or search listing
placement. Please weigh the pros and cons carefully before embarking on
text link advertising. If you do decide to go for it, this plugin will be
able to help.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4>What are &quot;Link Packages&quot; and &quot;Sold Links&quot;?</h4>

<p>Link Packages describe what you offer to your advertisers. They specify
your rates and other relevant information to entice advertisers to divert
some of the marketing budget in the direction of your blog. For instance,
you may have these packages: (1) &quot;AboveFold&quot; with Price=$100,
Expiry=720 (which is a month in hours) (2) &quot;AboveFold (3mo)&quot;
with Price=$250, Expiry=2160 (three months in hours) (3)
&quot;Footer&quot; with Price=$50, Expiry=720 and so on. You can list them
wherever you want by giving the shortcode <code>[ezlink packages]</code>.
You will also see all your packages listed on the <em>Easy Text Links</em>
admin page in a neat table, where you can inspect, modify or delete
them.</p>

<p>Sold Links are, naturally, the links you have sold to your advertisers.
You can display them on your posts or pages by the shortcode <code>[ezlink
links]</code>. If you want to display only a particular link (whose ID is,
say, link1), you would give the shortcode <code>[ezlink
links=link1]</code>. For multiple links, you give the shortcode as
<code>[ezlink links=link1,link2]</code>. Again, the sold links will appear
on the plugin admin page where you can manipulate them.</p>

<p>The links and products, when listed using the shortcode
<code>[ezlink]</code>, will be formatted as an unordered list
(<code>&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</code>).</p>

<h4>I don&#39;t want the links to be an unordered list. What can I
do?</h4>

<p>You can specify an option in the shortcode as <code>[ezlink
option=nolist]</code>. This option can be given with any combination of
<code>[ezlink packages]</code>, <code>[ezlink packages]</code> or
<code>[ezlink links=link1,link2,link3...]</code>.</p>

<h4>How do I specify a &quot;Advertise Here&quot; link pointing to a blog
page?</h4>

<p>You insert the shortcode <code>[ezlink invite]</code> (or <code>[ezlink
advertise]</code> or <code>[ezlink here]</code>) to display such an
invitation.</p>

<p>Note that you have to create the target page/post with a title like
&quot;Advertise Here&quot; or something similar and point to it on the
plugin admin page (under the <em>&quot;Advertise Here&quot; Target:</em>
option). Once that is done, your <code>[ezlink invite]</code> shortcode
will point to that page/post. In that page, you can use <code>[ezlink
packages]</code> shortcode to list your link packages, and give any
contact details so that your advertisers can get in touch with you.</p>

<h4>Can I have a full list of shortcode keywords and syntax?</h4>

<ol>
  <li>List packages (within <code>&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</code>) :
  <code>[ezlink packages]</code>.</li>

  <li>List all links (within <code>&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</code>) :
  <code>[ezlink links]</code></li>

  <li>List specific links (within <code>&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;</code>) :
  <code>[ezlink links=link1,link2,link3...]</code>.</li>

  <li>Suppress <code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>
  around any of the lists above : <code>[ezlink option=nolist
  ...]</code></li>

  <li>Advertise Here display : <code>[ezlink invite]</code> or
  <code>[ezlink advertise]</code> or <code>[ezlink here]</code></li>
</ol>

<h4>How can I get the links or packages in a widget?</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://buy.thulasidas.com/easy-text-links" title=
"Pro Version of Eazy Text Links for $7.95">Pro version</a> version of
<em>Easy Text Links</em> gives you basic support for widgets. You can use
the WordPress default Text widget to insert the shortcode and it will be
rendered as expected. A dedicated and multi-insertable widget with fully
configurable text links will be released later.</p>

<p>The lite version does not offer a widget. The work around is to install
the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/shortcode-widget/" title=
"Shortcode Widget plugin from WordPress directory">Shortcode Widget</a>.
You can then place the <code>[ezlink]</code> shortcodes in the widgets
provided by Shortcode Widget.</p>

<h4>I deleted/blocked a link by mistake. Now it has disappeared. How do I
get it back?</h4>

<p>Go to the admin page of the plugin, and edit the Sold Link by clicking
on the edit icon (green pencil) on the floating toolbar. You can then set
the status to anything other than Deleted or Hidden.</p>

<h4>I added a link. But it doesn&#39;t show up. What&#39;s wrong?</h4>

<p>Note that in the Pro version, you have to <em>Approve</em> the links
before they will be displayed. This is in preparation to letting your
advertisers specify link details after purchasing. You probably don&#39;t
want to allow such user specified content to appear on your blog without
checking. If you do, you will find an option (WIP) to allow it.</p>
