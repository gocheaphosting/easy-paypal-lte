<h3>Migrate IPN Data</h3>

<?php include('dev.html') ; ?>

<p>This tool copies the sales data from your existing sales database
table. It expects the data to be in <code>ipn_sales</code> table in
your database. To migrate data from some other table, edit the source
code.  The warning message you get when you hit the "Sales from DB"
button gives you the source code location. See the example screenshot
below. Note that you will also have to comment out the error line as
directed. </p>
