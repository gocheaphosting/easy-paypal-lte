  <li><b><a href="index.php?support"
  title="Read more about ezSupport">ezSupport</a></b>:
  Every complex software project, once
  deployed, generates significant support load. Most of the support
  questions are frivilous, where the end-user presents silly issues
  that are easily resolved by a cursory look at the documentation. How
  do we ask the end-user to RTFM without antagonizing them? I found
  that it could be done by switching to a paid support model. I
  started charging 95 cents per support questions, and my support load
  went down by two orders of magnitude. This ezSupport package is
  built on the excellent osTicket program. It works hand in hand with
  ezPayPal and provides you with a configurable support system. If you
  already have the <a href="http://buy.thulasidas.com/ezpaypal-pro"
  title="Get Easy PayPal Pro for $9.95">Standalone Pro</a> version of
  ezPayPal, you can easily buy and install <a

<p>A few more optional modules for <?php ezpp() ?> are in the pipeline:</p>

<ul> <li><b><a href="index.php?textlinks"
  title="Manage your text links like a pro for $7.95">
  ezTextLinks</a></b>: Do you have a high
  page-rank site? Do you get a lot of requests for text links?  They
  can be significantly more lucrative (by a factor of 100, in my case)
  than contextual ads such as AdSense. The returns can be even greater
  if you can deal with your advertisers directly, rather than via
  providers like Text Link Ads that take 50% of your
  revenue. ezTextLinks will handle payment, activate and expire links,
  send reminder emails and handle renewals etc. The plugin version is
  already available as Easy Text Links in <a
  href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-text-links"
  title="Lite version of Easy Text Links">Lite</a> and <a
  href="http://buy.thulasidas.com/easy-text-links"
  title="Manage your text links like a pro for $7.95">Pro</a></li>

  <li><b><a href="index.php?pageSales">Sell Your Pages</a></b>: Sell your
  blog pages in PDF format to your readers so that they can get something
  in return for supporting you. [Optional Module -- Work in
  Progress].</li>
