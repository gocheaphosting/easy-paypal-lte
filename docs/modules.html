<h1>Optional Modules</h1>

<p><?php ezpp() ?> is designed to be extensible. Already in the pipeline
are the following optional extensions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>ezAffiliates: Create your own affiliate network and go viral by
  turing your satisfied customers into your advertising affiliatees. This
  package, built on the pubicly available Affiliates-for-All, integrates
  perfectly with to automate affiliate sales tracking and commission
  computation and more.</li>

  <li>ezReports: Maximize your sales by analyzing your sales. This
  reporting package makes slicing and dicing your sales and affiliate data
  a snap, so that you can spot opportunities.</li>

  <li>ezTextLinks: Do you have a high page-rank site? Do you get a lot of
  requests for text links? They can be significantly more lucrative (by a
  factor of 100, in my case) than contextual ads such as AdSense. The
  returns can be even greater if you can deal with your advertisers
  directly, rather than via providers like Text Link Ads that take 50% of
  your revenue. ezTextLinks will handle payment, activate and expire
  links, send reminder emails and handle renewals etc.</li>

  <li>ezSupport: Every complex software project, once deployed, generates
  significant support load. Most of the support questions are frivilous,
  where the end-user presents silly issues that are easily resolved by a
  cursory look at the documentation. How do we ask the end-user to RTFM
  without antagonizing them? I found that it could be done by switching to
  a paid support model. I started charging 95 cents per support questions,
  and my support load went down by two orders o magnitude. This ezSupport
  package is built on the excellent osTicket program. It works hand in
  hand with <?php ezpp() ?> and provides you with a configurable support
  system.</li>

  <li>PageSales: Another project built on <?php ezpp() ?> is a
  WordPress plugin to sell your blog pages in nicely fromatted
  printable PDF files. Page Sales, when priced right, can be a perfect
  way for your appreciative readers to send you donations.</li>
