<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h4>Can I use this package without *ezPayPal*?</h4>

<p>Not in the current form. A future version that can work independently
of <em>ezPayPal</em> will be released soon.</p>

<h4>Why would I want to charge my users for support?</h4>

<p>Not to get rich, for sure! In my case, I have a few popuplar plugins
and packages out there on the net. My users kept sending me emails with
questions that are clearly answered in the FAQ, documentation etc. When I
got tired of cutting and pasting the FAQ answers, I decided to charge them
a small amount ($0.95) per question. In fact, I didn&#39;t really charge
them, I just told them that I would. And, to my surprise, my support load
went down by over 90%! I wanted to use a support ticket system, but was
worried that it would swamp me with frivilous tickets. A paid support
model made sense in my case. Besides, it will certainly cut down on
spam.</p>

<h4>Why do the email messages from ezSupport end up in Spam/Junk mail
boxes?</h4>

<p>Depending on how your PHP installation is configured, your emails may
look like spam to some of the mail sentinel out there. The safest way to
overcome this is to set up SMTP for outgoing mail. Logon to your ezSupport
Admin panel (<code>&lt;your ezSupport site&gt;/scp/admin.php</code>) and
click on the Emails tab. Click on the &quot;Support&quot; email (typically
<code><a href=
"mailto:support@yoursite.com">support@yoursite.com</a></code>) and enter
the values in the &quot;SMTP Settings (Optional)&quot; and section. You
will also need to enter your login info in the &quot;Login info
(optional)&quot; subsection.</p>
