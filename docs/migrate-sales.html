<h3>Migrate Sales</h3>

<?php include('dev.html') ; ?>

<p>This tool copies your sales data from individual PHP files
and inserts them in your database. It expects the sales data to be
in a particular format. To migrate data from some other format, edit the source
code.  The warning message you get when you hit the "Import Sales"
button gives you the source code location. See the example screenshot
below. Note that you will also have to comment out the error line as
directed. </p>
