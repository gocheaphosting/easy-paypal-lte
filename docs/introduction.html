<h1>Intoduction</h1>Thank you for choosing <?php ezpp() ?>. You will find
it easy to setup and use. The initial setup is so simple and intuitive
that you may be able to start earning revenue in a matter of minutes
without even having to read this manual. You will find all the advanced
features and options of <?php ezpp() ?> documented in this manual.

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p><?php ezpp() ?> is a package to turn your website into an automated
e-shop to sell your digital goods (such as eBooks, photos, programs etc.)
It uses PayPal Instant Payment Notification (IPN) to automate everything
from payments from your customers to product delivery. Aiming at
simplicity and robustness, <?php ezpp() ?> does all the heavy lifting
invovled in IPN posting, verification, product and payment validation,
buyer download link generation, email etc., so that your e-shop can run
unattended for months, generating revnue. As a payment solution,
<?php ezpp() ?> finds itself in between PayPal buy-now buttons and
shopping carts.</p>

<h2>Why not use PayPal buttons?</h2>

<p>PayPal "Buy Now" buttons are great if you sell a couple of eBooks or
photos or programs a week. Yu get the payment and either email the product
or manually create a download link for your buyer. Clearly, it is not a
scalable solution. For one thing, all your payment and delivery
information is in your email account, and your product definitions are on
PayPal site. They should all be in a database under your control. Besides,
once your products become popular, you will be spending an inordinate
amount oftime servicing orders. If you want to add more products, you will
have to generate new buttons and cut and paste the HTML code to your web
pages.</p>

<p>With <?php ezpp() ?>, you will add a new product using a dedicated web
interface. The moment it is defined your new product will appear on yopur
website ready to be bought by your customers. All the payment and customer
data will be sotred so that you can have detailed reports, start your own
affiliate networks, or link exchange systems etc. Infinitely more
powerful, yet simpler than buttons.</p>

<h2>Why not use a shopping cart?</h2>

<p>I found shopping carts too cumbersome both for my customers and for my
backend administration purposes. My customers typically wantto purchase
and download one copy of a program or an eBook of mine with no fuss.
Having them go through multiple screens of registration, login etc. before
they can get to the payment gateway is suboptimal in the context of
downloadable digital goods. The overall user experience needs to be as
close to the one-click buy a la Apple App Store as possible. Hence
<?php ezpp() ?>.</p>

<p>In addition to the unweildy user-experience, the backend administration
(product setup, customer and payment management etc.) in shopping carts is
also heavy-handed for the purpose of digital goods sales. Combined with
their typically high price range, the administrative costs render the
shopping carts unsuitable for me. <?php ezpp() ?>, on the other hand, is
designed spcifically for downloadable digital goods, and provides a
streamlined experience for your buyers and your admin staff. But, if your
inventory includes physical goods, <?php ezpp() ?> may not be the right
solution for you.</p>

<h2>Different Versions and Features</h2>
<?php ezpp() ?>comes in two stand-alone
versions, Standard (also known as Lite) and Pro. It also comes as a
WordPress plugin, again in Standard and Pro versions.

<h3>Standard Features</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Minimal setup and administration load: <?php ezpp() ?> gets you
  started with your online shop within minutes, rather than hours and
  days.</li>

  <li>Generous help and hints during setup: Whenever you need help, the
  information and hint is only a click away. (In fact, only a mouseover
  away.)</li>

  <li>Automatic validation of admin and setup entries to minimize errors:
  <?php ezpp() ?> catches all the usual data entry errors so that you can
  afford to be a bit sloppy.</li>

  <li>Very little programming knowledge required: This program is written
  for creative people who have some digital products to sell. So it
  doesn't call for any deep computing knowledge. The most you will have to
  do is perhaps to set permission to a couple of folders.</li>

  <li>Handles all the complex PayPal instant notification and data
  transfer to prevent unauthorized access.</li>

  <li>Buyers are automatically redirected to a download page.</li>

  <li>Self-service download link retrieval: If the PayPal information is
  not yet received by your server, your buyer will see a page where he can
  retrieve his purchase link. (This feature reduced my support load by
  90%).</li>

  <li>In addition to the download page, an automated email with the
  download link is sent to your buyer as well. Just in case...</li>

  <li>Easy to add new products to your inventory.</li>

  <li>Automatic generation of an online shop. Once the first product is
  added, you can already see it on your online shop.</li>
</ol>

<p><?php ezpp() ?> is available as a freely distributed <a href=
"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-paypal-lte/" title=
"Freely distributed WordPress plugin">WordPress plugin</a> as well as a
<a href="http://buy.thulasidas.com/ezpaypal" title=
"Get ezPayPal stand-alone for $4.95">standalone package</a>.</p>

<h3>Security Features</h3>

<p>Since <?php ezpp() ?> deals with money, it takes the security and
integrity of your data very seriously. It also puts serious roadblocks to
prevent unauthorized access to your server.</p>

<ol>
  <li>All login type actions are implemented in such a way as to virtually
  eliminate the possibility of SQL injection attacks.</li>

  <li>The <code>setup.php</code> (which you are advised to remove after
  successful installation) script doesn't let you set up your installation
  twice. In fact, it won't even display the setup information the second
  time you run it. Reinstallation will require database manipulation.</li>

  <li>Only one admin user is permitted. You cannot add another admin
  user.</li>

  <li>There is no interface to recover your password once you install your
  system. No amount of database hacking will recover it. So please be
  careful to note it down in some secure location.</li>

  <li>Strong validation of all user entries exposed to the world.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Pro Features</h3>

<p>In addition to the fully functional Lite version, there is a <a href=
"http://buy.thulasidas.com/ezpaypal-pro" title=
"Get ezPayPal Pro for $9.95">Pro Stand-Alone Version</a> with many more
features. The WordPress plugin is also available in the <a href=
"http://buy.thulasidas.com/easy-paypal" title=
"Get Easy PayPal Pro -- Premium WordPress Plugin -- for $9.95">Pro Plugin
Version</a>.</p>

<p>If the following features are important to you, consider buying the
<em>Pro</em> version.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Data Security</em>: The <em>Pro</em> version takes special
  measures to set up data verification links to ensure your sales data is
  safe and not susceptible to corruption. In technical terms, it checks
  for the existence of InnoDB in your MySQL installation, and uses it if
  found, setting up foreign keys to ensure referential integrity, and
  indices to guarantee performance. The Lite version uses the default
  MyISAM engine, fast and simple, but not exactly secure.</li>

  <li><em>Sandbox Mode</em>: In the <em>Pro</em> version, you have the
  option to choose PayPal sandbox mode so that you can check your setup
  before going live.</li>

  <li><em>HTML Emails</em>: In the <em>Pro</em> version, you can send
  impressive HTML email to your customers rather than the boring plain
  text messages.</li>

  <li><em>Template Editor</em>: The email body, thank you page and
  download display are all editable in the <em>Pro</em> version.</li>

  <li>Automatic handling of refunds and disputes. When you issue a refund
  on the PayPal website, the corresponding sale in your database will be
  set to inactive. And if a buyer registers a dispute, he (and you) will
  get a friendly email message stating that the dispute is being reviewed
  and handled.</li>

  <li>E-Check handling. The <em>Pro</em> version recognizes e-check
  payments and sends a mail to the buyer regarding the delay for the check
  clearance.</li>

  <li><em>Sales Editor</em>: You can load a single sale or a bunch of
  sales on to a friendly interface and change their data. For instance, it
  will let you change the download expiry date and resend a download
  notification message -- one of the frequent support requests from the
  buyers.</li>

  <li><em>Email Tools</em>: You can select a number of your buyers to
  notify, for example, of a critical update of your products, or of a free
  upgrade opportunity.</li>

  <li><em>Product Version Support</em>: The <em>Pro</em> version supports
  versioning of your products. It will keep track of the version sold to
  your buyers and your current versions. So, if you want to send a product
  and version specific upgrade notice, you can do it with <em>Pro</em>
  version.</li>

  <li><em>Batch Upload</em>: The <em>Pro</em> version gives an easy way to
  upload your product files (when you release new versions, for instance),
  and keeps track of their versions.</li>

  <li><em>Additional Tools</em>: The <em>Pro</em> version also gives you a
  bunch of tools (php example files) that can help you migrate your
  existing sales data or product definitions.</li>

  <li><em>Data Migration</em>: Using this <em>Pro</em> tool, your database
  tables can be automatically upgraded to the later version without losing
  your sales info and other settings.</li>

  <li><em>DB Backup</em>: The <em>Pro</em> version has an option to
  generate a backup of your sales info to download to a safe
  location.</li>

  <li><em>DB Restore</em>: It also provides a means to restore (of course)
  a previously backed up data file, overwriting (or appending to, as you
  wish) the existing sales info. (WIP)</li>

  <li><em>Security Audit</em>: The <em>Pro</em> version provides you with
  a tool to check your settings and installation for possible security
  issues.</li>

  <li><em>Product Updates</em>: Your customers can initiate product update
  checks. If the version they purchased is older than the current version
  on your shop, they can download the latest version. Bu default, the
  first update is provided free of cost, and the subsequent ones are
  chargeable at $0.95. In later versions, this update policy will be
  configurable on a product-by-product basis.</li>

  <li><em>Upgradeable Products</em>: You can define products that are
  upgradeable. For instance, you can sell a short eBook at an introductory
  price. If your buyer likes it, he has the option of buying the full book
  by paying the difference. (WIP)</li>
</ol>

<p>If you buy the <em>Pro</em> version, you will get an upgrade notice
(using the last item listed above) when the features that are
Work-in-Progress are completed. You will be able to update free of
charge.</p>

<h3>Optional Packages</h3>

<p><?php ezpp() ?> is designed to be extensible. Already in the pipeline
are the following optional extensions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>ezAffiliates: Create your own affiliate network and go viral by
  turing your satisfied customers into your advertising affiliatees. This
  package, built on the pubicly available Affiliates-for-All, integrates
  perfectly with to automate affiliate sales tracking and commission
  computation and more.</li>

  <li>ezReports: Maximize your sales by analyzing your sales. This
  reporting package makes slicing and dicing your sales and affiliate data
  a snap, so that you can spot opportunities.</li>

  <li>ezTextLinks: Do you have a high page-rank site? Do you get a lot of
  requests for text links? They can be significantly more lucrative (by a
  factor of 100, in my case) than contextual ads such as AdSense. The
  returns can be even greater if you can deal with your advertisers
  directly, rather than via providers like Text Link Ads that take 50% of
  your revenue. ezTextLinks will handle payment, activate and expire
  links, send reminder emails and handle renewals etc.</li>

  <li>ezSupport: Every complex software project, once deployed, generates
  significant support load. Most of the support questions are frivilous,
  where the end-user presents silly issues that are easily resolved by a
  cursory look at the documentation. How do we ask the end-user to RTFM
  without antagonizing them? I found that it could be done by switching to
  a paid support model. I started charging 95 cents per support questions,
  and my support load went down by two orders o magnitude. This ezSupport
  package is built on the excellent osTicket program. It works hand in
  hand with <?php ezpp() ?> and provides you with a configurable support
  system.</li>

  <li>PageSales: Another project built on <?php ezpp() ?> is a
  WordPress plugin to sell your blog pages in nicely fromatted
  printable PDF files. Page Sales, when priced right, can be a perfect
  way for your appreciative readers to send you donations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that these extensions are designed to work with <a href=
"http://buy.thulasidas.com/ezpaypal-pro" title=
"Get Easy PayPal Pro for $9.95">Standalone Pro</a> version. They will be
ported to the <a href="http://buy.thulasidas.com/easy-paypal" title=
"Get Easy PayPal Pro for $6.95">Plugin Pro</a> version as well if
possible.</p>

<h2>Support and Product Updates</h2>

<p><?php ezpp() ?>comes with extensive documentation both on <a href=
'http://buy.thulasidas.com/docs'>its website</a> and as a part of the
distribution. The documentation is also available as a PDF file. But the
design of <?php ezpp() ?> is to make it so intuitive that you will seldom
need to refer to the documentation. To this end, the documentation is
actually integrated with the <?php ezpp() ?> interface at two
levels.</p><?php include('help.html') ; ?>

<p>Despite this large documentation effort, if you still find yourself
needing support, we have a paid support model. Please visit our <a href=
'http://support.thulasidas.com'>Support Portal</a> and raise a ticket.</p>

<p><?php ezpp() ?> and other programs sold at <a href=
'http://buy.thulasidas.com'>our e-shop</a> can be updated by visiting our
<a href='http://buy.thulasidas.com/pro/ez-update.php'>Update Portal</a>.
This portal will list the updates available to you and let you download or
purchase them. The first update for each of the programs is provided free
of cost, and the subsequent ones are charged a nominal $0.95.</p>
