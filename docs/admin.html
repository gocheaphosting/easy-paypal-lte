<h1>Administration</h1>

<p>Once you complete the initial setup, you can access the admin page,
where you specify your PayPal details, general options and define your digital
products.</p><?php include('help.html') ; ?>

<blockquote>
  <strong>Note:</strong> The screenshots below are from the Pro version of
  <?php ezpp() ?>. In the standard version, the Pro features and options
  will not be presented.
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have set up your <?php ezpp() ?>, you can enter the admin area
to configure it. You will need your admin credentials (that you set up
during installation setup), your PayPal email address (so that your
customers can pay you), and your database details (to save your potential
purchases -- you may need to contact your web server admin for this
information).</p>

<h2>Entering the Admin Control Panel</h2>

<h3>WordPress Plugin Versions</h3>

<p>To access the Admin Control Panel in your WordPress installation, log
on to your blog admin section (<code>http://yourblog/wp-admin</code>) and
click on "Easy PayPal Lite" or "Easy PayPal Pro" under your "Settings"
menu.</p><?php img("05") ?>

<h3>Standalone Versions</h3>

<p>You can enter the admin screen by clicking Admin button right after
installing <?php ezpp() ?>.</p><?php img("01") ?>

<p>You can also find a link to the Admin page in all the pages presented
by <?php ezpp() ?>. Look for it in the right hand side top corner as shown
below.</p><?php img("02") ?>

<p>Once you enter the admin page, the first thing you will be asked to do
is to authenticate yourself.</p><?php img("03") ?>

<blockquote>
  <b>Warning:</b> Please note down your Admin username and password. If you
  have forgotten either, there is no way to recover it. You will have to
  access your database and delete the table with a name like
  <code>ezpp_5e81f9859d223ea420aca993c647b839M</code>, where the part
  before the underscore is the database prefix you chose during
  installation, and the part after is a random string. After deleting this
  table, please go to the installation script
  (<code>http://yoursite/setup.php</code> where yoursite is the location
  where you installed<?php ezpp() ?>.
</blockquote>

<h2>Admin Sections</h2>

<p>Regardless of whether you are using the standalone or the WordPress
plugin version of <?php ezpp() ?>, you will get an Admin Control Panel as
the screenshots below. The Admin Control Panel has three
sections, and we will discuss them separately below.</p>

<p>In the Pro versions, these three sections are arranged as tabs, with
the Product Definition tab on top because we expect you to navigate to
it most often after your <?php ezpp() ?> is set up. Please access the
sections described below by clicking on the corresponding tabs.</p>

<p>The screenshots shown are from the Pro version of <?php ezpp() ?>. If you
have installed the Lite edition, you may see fewer option entries on this
screen. The easiest way to get information on a feature or option is to
hover over the <img src="../help.png" alt="(?)"> icon next to it.</p>

<h3>PayPal Details</h3>

<?php img("04a") ?>

<p>This section has the following fields.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>PayPal username</b>: Enter your name (or your company name). This
  is used for display purposes.</li>

  <li><b>PayPal email ID</b>: Enter your PayPal email ID, which will
  receive your payments.</li>

  <li><b>PayPal SandBox email ID</b>: PayPal SandBox email ID, which you
  can use for testing your setup. This entry is optional.</li>

  <li><b>Use SandBox [test] mode</b>: If checked, PayPal SandBox will be
  used.</li>

  <li><b>Email IPN Logs</b>: If checked, the PayPal IPN details (logs of
  the conversations between your server and PayPal) will be emailed to the
  support email address even in live mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>General Options</h3>

<?php img("04b") ?>

<p>This section has the following fields.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Support email ID</b>: An email ID where your buyers can contact
  you for support.</li>

  <li><b>Support Name</b>: A friendly name to go with your support email
  ID.</li>

  <li><b>Expire Time (in hours)</b>: The number of hours after which the
  download links will expire. When a purchase is made, an auto-generated
  email is sent to the buyer with a download link. The link expires after
  the number of hours you specify here. (I use 72 hours).</li>

  <li><b>Random Storage Location</b>: Randomize the storage location of
  your digital goods so that potential hackers cannot easily guess it?
  Recommended. Note that you will have to set the permission to the
  storage directory so that files can be uploaded there.</li>

  <li><b>Random File Name</b>: Randomize the file name of your digital
  goods on the server as you upload it so that potential hackers cannot
  easily guess it? Recommended.</li>

  <li><b>Location for Lite Versions</b>: Optional. If you plan to provide
  <b>Lite</b> versions of your products, here is where they will reside.
  Give the full pathname on the server, or a relative pathname under the
  <code>ezPayPal</code> folder.</li>

  <li><b>Location for Pro Versions</b>: If you plan to use non-random
  location for the <b>Pro</b> versions of your products, here is where
  they will reside. Note that non-random location is not recommended
  because it can be easily guessed and hacked into.<br>
  Give the full pathname on the server, or a relative pathname under the
  <code>ezPayPal</code> folder.</li>

  <li><b>Send HTML emails</b>: If checked, the emails sent your buyers
  with their download links will be in HTML format. You can customize the
  default HTML template with the Template editor, which you will find
  under Pro Tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Product Definitions</h3>

<?php img("04c") ?>

<p>Here is where you define your digital products. This section has the
following fields.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Product Code</b>: A short code for the digital product you want
  to sell. e.g., ezPro. This key field needs to be unique. The
  drop-down menu is editable. (To add a new product, just type in a new
  Product Code. To edit an existing one, either select it from the
  menu or type it in.)</li>

  <li><b>Product Name</b>: A descriptive name of the digital product you
  want to sell. e.g., Easy AdSense Pro - Premium AdSense Plugin for
  WordPress bloggers</li>

  <li><b>Activate this Product?</b>: Leave this option checked to list the
  product in your shop. Unchecking it is equivalent to deleting the
  product. It will not be listed, nor can it be bought.</li>

  <li><b>Product Category</b>: An optional category for the product, which
  you can use for grouping similar products together. You can have
  categories like Apps, Plugins, eBooks, Photos, Songs etc. (The
  drop-down menu is editable. To add a new category, just type in a
  new name. To edit an existing one, either select it from the menu or
  type it in.)</li>

  <li><b>Product Grouping</b>: An optional grouping for your products,
  this field can contain higher level groupins, like Software (for Apps,
  Plugins, for instance), Creative (e.g. for eBooks, Photos) and so on.
  This field can help you organize or autogenerate your e-shop pages as
  your business grows. (The drop-down menu is editable. To add a new
  grouping, just type in a new name. To edit an existing one, either
  select it from the menu or type it in.)</li>

  <li><b>Product Price</b>: Enter only numbers. e.g. 4.95</li>

  <li><b>Product Currency</b>: Specify the currency in which the product
  price is give. e.g. USD.</li>

  <li>
    <b>Shipping Address Needed</b>: Specify whether PayPal will ask for a
    shipping address for this product:

    <ol start="0">
      <li>Prompt for (but not require) an address</li>

      <li>Do not prompt for an address</li>

      <li>Prompt for an address, and require one</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><b>Product File Name</b>: When your customers buy your digital
  product, this is the file they will download.</li>

  <li><b>Your Digital Product</b>: This is the actual digital product that
  you want to put up for sale using ezPayPal. It can be a zip archive,
  photos, PDF files etc. If you have multiple files making up the product,
  please make a zip archive of it first. Note that the file you upload
  does not need to have the same name you specify as <b>Product File
  Name</b>. The real file will be saved on your server under a random file
  name in a random location so that it will not be easily discovered by
  potential hackers.</li>

  <li><b>Product Version</b>: Your sales will keep track of the product
  versions so that you can, for example, send upgrade notifications to
  your buyers. You would use the Email Tools (found under Pro Tools) for
  this purpose. Use a numeric version with two decimals (like 3.12 to
  indicate major version 3, minor version 1 and update 2, for instance).
  String versions (like V3.1.2) are not supported.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have defined at least one product, your e-shop is already up
(in the standalone versions) at <code>http://yoursite/ez-shop.php</code>.
In WordPress plugin editions, you will use shortcodes to generate a shop
front or "Buy Now!" kind of links. See the chapter on
<a href="index.php?shop">Your Shop</a> for details.</p>
