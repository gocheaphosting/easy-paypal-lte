<h2>Sales Editor</h2>

<p>One of the major difficulties with most e-commerce packages is the
near-impossibility of editing your transactions in any meaningful way. All
you can do is to manipulate your database using some tool like phpMyAdmin.
Since you may not know the data semantics that the developer had in mind,
you are playing with fire when you edit the data directly. You may end up
violating some referential constraint and make your program unusable.</p>

<p>Despite this danger, there are times when you have to do it. For
instance, a particular sale may have expired before your buyer had a
chance to download his product (which tends to happen quite often for me).
You may want to reset the expiry of this particular sale so that the
download link works again.</p>

<p><?php ezpp() ?> enables you to edit your transactions in a
semantic-aware fashion (meaning, you won't irrevocably mess up the data
while editing). The interface to do this is the Sales Editor.</p>

<h3>Single Sale Editing</h3>

<p>When you start up the Sales Editor by hitting appropriate button on the
Pro Control Panel, you enter the Single Sale Editor mode. As the text in
the interface says, if you want to quickly modify a single sale, and/or
send a fresh download email to your buyer, you can use this section.
First, load the single sale by providing either the email ID of the buyer
or the PayPal transaction ID. If you provide the email ID, the latest sale
by that buyer will be loaded. You can then change the expiry date (of the
download link) below, if you like. If the expiry date is in the future,
you will have the option to resend the email message with the download
information to your buyer.</p><?php img("01") ?>

<p>Once you load the sale, you can inspect it by clicking on the "Show"
button, or discard it and start over by hitting the "Discard" button.
Discarding means unloading the sale from the Sales Editor memory, not
deleting it from your database. (In fact, there is no interface in
<?php ezpp() ?> that will let you delete critical information from the
database. You will have to use other tools, like phpMyAdmin or a DB
client, to do that.)</p>

<p>Note that the actions on Sales Editor (like resetting the expiry or
sending email) will require further confirmation on a popup dialog
box.</p>

<h3>Bulk Editing Multiple Sales</h3>

<p>When you select the Multiple Sales Editor mode, you will get the window
below. To get started with editing sales, first load all your sales from
your database. Click on the button below. Don't worry, it is a
non-destructive, read-only operation.Once loaded, you can view them by
clicking on the 'Show Sales' button. And hide the displayed table by the
'Hide Sales' button.</p><?php img("02") ?>

<p>Once the sales are loaded (which might take a few minutes if you have a
lot of them in your database), you will get the following window. The
window contains generous amount of help in terms of text, status messages
and tooltips.</p><?php img("03") ?>

<p>The top part of the screen shows the number of sales loaded, and gives
you options to display them. The second part, titled "Filter Multiple
Trades," lets you narrow the sales loaded in a variety of ways. Once the
filtering is done, you can examine the selected sales. The last part of
the window (titled "Edit the Filterd Sales") will let you set the expiry
date, affiliate ID (if you want to manually track affiliate sales -- not
fully implemented yet), the sale status (Refunded, Voided, Completed or
Pending), the version sold to the buyer, and the current version of the
product.</p>

<p>Despite the dire warning in red about the finality of the edits, your
modifications are not actually applied in the current version. The code to
do so is not hard to write, but such direct database manipulations have to
be done with extreme care. After more tests, the code will be activated in
a future version.</p>

<h3>Editing Unprocessed Sales</h3>

<p>Unprocessed sales are the ones where the communication between PayPal
and <?php ezpp() ?> was disrupted in some fashion. In order to understand
it, you need to know how PayPal IPN works.</p>

<blockquote>
  From <a href=
  'https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=developer/e_howto_admin_IPNIntro'>
  PayPal</a> site:

  <ul>
    <li>PayPal sends your IPN listener a message that notifies you of the
    event</li>

    <li>Your listener sends the complete unaltered message back to PayPal;
    the message must contain the same fields in the same order and be
    encoded in the same way as the original message</li>

    <li>PayPal sends a single word back, which is either VERIFIED if the
    message originated with PayPal or INVALID if there is any discrepancy
    with what was originally sent</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The network traffic can fail at any of these steps. Knowing this, <?php
  ezpp() ?> plays it safe -- as soon as it receives the information from
the first step, it saves the information into your database. If the
communication or the processing fails during any subsequent steps, you can
still recover from the error later on using this "Editing Unprocessed
Sales" feature. The window you get when you choose this mode is shown
below.</p><?php img("04") ?>

<p>From the help text on the interfce: this mode helps you locate
unprocessed sales and process them. An unprocessed sale is one which got
PayPal IPN info, but either failed validation or post-back. (Refer to IPN
guide for more information). These transactions could, in principle, be
fraudulent -- attempts by hackers to get your product without paying for
it. But most often, it is some network issue preventing your server from
validating the transaction with PayPal. Action: verify the transaction on
the PayPal website before shipping your product.</p>

Once you load the unprocessed sales (by clicking on the button titled
  "Load Unprocessed Sales"), you get the following window. In order to
  display the unprocessed sales loaded, hit the "Show Filtered Sales"
  button. You can then process the individual sales by
  clicking on the "Process" button on the corresponding row. If you so
  choose, you can send the download email to the buyer while
  processing the sale by checking the option.
