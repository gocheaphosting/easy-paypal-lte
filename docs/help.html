  <p><strong>Timely Help:</strong> On all setup, admin and Pro screens in
  <?php ezpp() ?>, you can hover over the <img src="../help.png" alt=
  "(?)"> icon next to a feature or option to bring up a tooltip with
  detailed information about feature or option under consideration so that
  you don't have to refer to this manual every time you need help.
  <?php ezpp() ?> will also validate your inputs and present warnings or
  error messages to guide you along.</p>

  <p>To get the help page specific to an <?php ezpp() ?> screen you are
  working with, look for the <img src="../help.png" alt="(?)"> icon to the
  right of the page title. Click on it and you will get a page specific to
  the page. If such a help file is not ready yet, you will see this
  message.</p>
