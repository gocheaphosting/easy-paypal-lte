<h2>Migration Tools</h2>

<?php include('dev.html') ; ?>

<p>The migration tools are sample scripts provided developers and
integrators working on migrating data from an existing system to <?php
ezpp() ?>. These tools were originally developed for my own migration
efforts. For a casual user with no existing data to migrate, they may be
of limited use.</p>

<p>When you enter the migration tools window, you get four options, which
are described below. As usual, there is ample tooltip help to guide you
along.</p><?php img("01") ?>

<ul>
  <li><b>Migrate/backup DB prefix</b>: Use this tool to import data from a
  database schema with a given prefix, say, <code>ezpp_</code> to a new
  one, say, <code>mine_</code>. Using this tool, you can back up your
  existing data into another set of DB tables. This tool can also update
  your DB tables during a package version upgrade.</li>

  <li><b>Import sales from a DB table</b>: Use this tool to import sales
  data from a database table, if you have sales data created by some other
  package in a DB table. You will have to modify the file
  <code>migrate-ipnData.php</code> to match your table schema.</li>

  <li><b>Import PHP product definitions</b>: If your old products are
  defined in PHP files, import them from the existing PHP files. You will
  have to modify the file <code>migrate-products.php</code>. [This tool is
  of limited use.]</li>

  <li><b>Import PHP sales data</b>: Import Sales info from existing PHP
  files. If your sales data was written to individual PHP files, this tool
  can import them into your database. You will have to modify the file
  <code>migrate-sales.php</code>. [This tool is of limited use.]</li>
</ul>

Since these tools are meant to be used after modification, clicking on
the button to launch any one of them will bring up a warning and
confirmation as shown below.

To ensure that you do go through and modify the scripts, all but the
first one (DB Prefix Migration) will not do anything to your data
unless you edit the scripts and comment out the error line as shown
below. I know, it is a lot of confirmations, but direct database
manipulation is dangerous and has to be carried out with extreme care,
as any experience developer will tell you.
