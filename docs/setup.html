<h1>Installtion</h1>

<p><?php ezpp() ?> is a database program written in PHP. It requires PHP
and mySQL on your webserver. Don't worry, most webservers do. If you run
WordPress or any other kind of blog or content management system on your
server, you have what it takes to run <?php ezpp() ?>. Please have the
database connection details handy so that you can complete <?php ezpp() ?>
setup.</p><?php include('help.html') ; ?>

<h2>Wordpress Versions</h2>

<p>The standard plugin version can be downloaded and installed from within
the admin interface of your blog. Search for Easy PayPal and hit "Install
Now."</p><?php img("04") ?>

<p>You can use your blog admin interface to install the Pro version of the
plugin as well. Use the Upload page to locate and install the downloaded
zip archive.</p><?php img("05") ?>

<p>Congratulations! Your installation is now complete.</p>

<h2>Standalone Versions</h2>

<p>Unlike the WordPress version, the standalone version needs to know your
database connection details. It also needs you to set up an admin user
name and password for security. In the WordPress version, these entities
are already defined in your blog, and <?php ezpp ?> reusese them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Unzip and upload the downloaded package (<code>ezpapal.zip</code> or
  <code>ezpaypal-pro.zip</code>) to your sever.</li>

  <li>Browse to the location using your web browser.
  <?php img("01") ?></li>

  <li>Choose a admin user name and a strong password, and enter your
  database connection details. The setup page will generate the
  configuration file. Your <?php ezpp() ?> is now fully set up. You will
  get the following message indicating the successful installation.
  <?php img("02") ?></li>

  <li>If there are errors in creating the configuration file, you will get
  detailed instructions as to how to correct the issue. Just follow the
  instructions to complete the installation. <?php img("03") ?></li>

  <li>If you have misconfigured <?php ezpp() ?>, you will have to remove
  the configuration file (<code>rm ezppCfg.php</code>) and recreate it
  following the instructions in the previous step. <?php ezpp() ?>
  intentionally makes it difficult to recover from errors because error
  recovery interfaces are also security holes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the descriptions of the various fields on the installation
screen. In keeping with the <?php ezpp() ?> philosophy of providing help
where it most matters, these descriptions are available to you on the
installation screen itself, by hovering over the <img src="../help.png"
alt="(?)"> icon next to the field.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Admin User Name</b>: Use an alphanumeric string as the username,
  with the first character a letter. Best not to use names like admin,
  root, staff or your name -- these can be easily guessed.</li>

  <li><b>Password</b>: Use a password that cannot be easily guessed. Be
  sure to note it down or keep it some secure password keeper program.
  ezPayPal takes security very seriously and you will not be able to
  retrieve the password or reinstall the package without some serious
  work. You are not allowed to change Admin password, although you can
  create a new Admin account.</li>

  <li><b>Password (again)</b>: Type in your password again for
  verification.</li>

  <li><b>Table Prefix</b>: Use a prefix for all the database tables so
  that you can easily identify them. The suggested prefix
  <code>ezpp_</code> is a decent one, but to enhance your security, you
  may want to choose a different one.</li>

  <li><b>Hostname</b>: If your database is hosted on a different server,
  please provide its name. Usually, MySQL databases are hosted at the same
  server as your Webserver, in which case, you can use
  <code>localhost</code> as your database server.</li>

  <li><b>Database Name</b>: If you are using a dedicated database created
  using your CPanel or other hosting provider interface, please provide
  its name. It usually has the form <code>username_dbname</code>. If you
  have limits on the number of databases you can create on your server,
  you can reuse an existing database. If not, it is best to create a
  dedicated one for your PayPal activities.</li>

  <li><b>Username</b>: Your username to log on to the database server. It
  is typically the same as the database name itself.</li>

  <li><b>Password</b>: Your database password.</li>

  <li><b>Email ID</b>: Optional. This email ID will be used to send
  Database error messages from your ezPayPal installation. If there are
  errors during IPN transactions, ezPayPal sends messages to the support
  email ID you have (or will) set up in <code>admin.php</code>. However,
  if the DB cannot be connected to, the support email ID stored in the DB
  cannot be accessed, and diagnostic messages cannot be sent. So, this is
  the only email Id the program will have access to. If you do not want
  emails about DB errors, please give a fake email ID like
  <code>nobody@nowhere.com</code></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Be careful about the admin username and
  password. Since <?php ezpp() ?> takes security very seriously, it
  wouldn't let you retrieve a lost password. Resetting the password will
  require database operations.

<h2>Optional Addon Modules</h2>

<p><?php ezpp() ?> is designed to be extensible. You can enhance the
functionality of the Pro Standalone version by purchasing and installing
optional modules. Their installation is even easier than the simple
installation of <?php ezpp() ?> described above. The array of modules
available and under development are listed below, and described in greater
detail in subsequent chapters.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>ezAffiliates:</strong> Create your own affiliate network and
  go viral by turing your satisfied customers into your advertising
  affiliatees. This package, built on the pubicly available
  Affiliates-for-All, integrates perfectly with to automate affiliate
  sales tracking and commission computation and more.</li>

  <li><strong>ezReports:</strong> Maximize your sales by analyzing your
  sales. This reporting package makes slicing and dicing your sales and
  affiliate data a snap, so that you can spot opportunities.</li>

  <li><strong>ezTextLinks:</strong> Do you have a high page-rank site? Do
  you get a lot of requests for text links? They can be significantly more
  lucrative (by a factor of 100, in my case) than contextual ads such as
  AdSense. The returns can be even greater if you can deal with your
  advertisers directly, rather than via providers like Text Link Ads that
  take 50% of your revenue. ezTextLinks will handle payment, activate and
  expire links, send reminder emails and handle renewals etc.</li>

  <li><strong>ezSupport:</strong> Every complex software project, once
  deployed, generates significant support load. Most of the support
  questions are frivilous, where the end-user presents silly issues that
  are easily resolved by a cursory look at the documentation. How do we
  ask the end-user to RTFM without antagonizing them? I found that it
  could be done by switching to a paid support model. I started charging
  95 cents per support questions, and my support load went down by two
  orders o magnitude. This ezSupport package is built on the excellent
  osTicket program. It works hand in hand with <?php ezpp() ?> and
  provides you with a configurable support system.</li>
</ol>
