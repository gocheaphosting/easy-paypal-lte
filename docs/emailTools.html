<h2>Email Tools</h2>

<p>The Email Tools lets you keep in touch with your customers in a variety
of ways. When you launch it from the Pro Control Panel, you are
greeted with the following window.</p>

<p>As you can see, this window is designed to be self-documenting, with
generous help texts and tooltips to guide you along. For instance,
once you filter a set of email addresses to send messages to, you get
the following message about what kind of email templates you can use.

Since sending potentially large number of emails is usually frowned
upon by the recipients, the Email Tools warns you about it multiple
times and makes you jump through some software hoops (confirmation
dialogs, test emails etc.) before you can actually send out bulk email.
