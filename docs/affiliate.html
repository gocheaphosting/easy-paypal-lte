  program. This is where your affiliates log on to. If you have a domain
  or subdomain for it, you may want to enter it here instead of the
  default value.</li>

  <li><b>Affiliate Referrer Parameter</b>: his parameter is used in
  affiliate links, and contains the affiliate number. For example, a link
  might look like http://...?ref=123 for affiliate 123.</li>

  on a different domain to your store. For example, if you have<br>
  <code>http://www.example.com</code><br>
  for your store and <code>https://secure.example.com</code><br>
  for your checkout, you should set <code>cookie_domain</code> to
  example.com. Note that <code>ezAffiliates</code> will not work at all if
  the store and cart are on completely different domains. For example, you
  might have<br>
  http://www.example.com<br>
  for your store, and<br>
  https://example.secureserver.com<br>

  an affiliate cookie set on their browsers, set it to FALSE. For example,
  suppose an affiliate introduces customer X. X places an order and the
  affiliate receives commission. After that, X changes browser, meaning
  that he no longer has an affiliate cookie set. He then places another
