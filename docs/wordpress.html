<h3>Quick Start with WordPress Plugin Version</h3>

<p>It is easy to get started with <?php ezpp() ?> in this WordPress
plugin version. Please follow the steps below.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you see any warning or error messages above in red, please take
  care of it first.</li>
<li>Please set up your PayPal Details above.</li>
<li>Set up your General Options above</li>
<li>Add a product by providing its Product Definition and uploading
it.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote id='warnmessage'>

Valid product codes:<code> abc_2345, ITEM02, a789, xyz </code>etc.
<br />
Invalid product codes:<code> abc 123, ITEM:02, a-789, x+y$z
</code>etc.

<p>Once a product is added to your repository, your e-shop is ready to
be displayed on your blog. The display is controlled using <a
 href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode" target="_blank">WordPress
Short Codes</a>. In order to show the whole shop, create a new page or
post with the short code <code>[ezshop]</code>. This will present your
whole e-shop in a neat tabular form within the page or post.</p>

<p>Note that by default, a page (<em><a
 href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/post-vs-page/"
target="_blank">not a post</a></em>) with the slug
<code>ez-shop</code> (or <code>ez-shop-n</code>, where <code>n</code>
is a number like 1, 2, 3 etc.) is created for you. Please do not
delete this page even if you create other e-shop pages. This page is
used as the IPN listener, which will receive the messages from
PayPal. This page also serves as your digital goods delivery
portal. In other words, if you delete this page, your <?php ezpp() ?>
e-shop may not work at all.</p>

<p>Note also that you have to use <a
 href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks"
target="_blank">pretty permalinks</a> for the auto-generated shop
front to work. Take a look at the URL address of the shop front (in
the address bar on your web browser). Does it say something like
http://your.blog/?p=123? If so, go to your WordPress dashboard,
Settings -> Permalinks and select any setting other than the (ugly)
default one.</p>

<p>Each product can be displayed as a "Buy Now" kind of link with the
short code <code>[ezshop buy='product_code']Buy this product
now![/ezshop]</code>. This will insert a link, which when clicked, will
take your reader to a PayPal page to buy the product.</p>

<p>You can display your product links using <code>[ezshop
show='product_code']View this product now![/ezshop]</code>. It will
show page describing your product benefits, with a count-down timer
which will take your reader to PayPal in fifteen seconds.</p>

<p>In either <code>buy=product_code</code> or
<code>show=product_code</code> short codes, you can temporarily
suppress the link generation by specifying <code>link='no'</code>,
(e.g., <code>[ezshop show='product_code' link='no']View this product
now![/ezshop]</code>).  In this case, your whole e-shop will be
displayed as though you specified just <code>[ezshop]</code>. This
way, you can easily toggle between links and e-shop.</p>
