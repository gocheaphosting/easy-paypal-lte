<h3>Migrate Database Prefix</h3>

<?php include('dev.html') ; ?>

<p><?php ezpp() ?> stores its data in your MySQL database tables. In order
to group them together, it uses a prefix, such as <code>ezpp_</code> in
the standalone versions, or <code>wp_ezpp_</code> in the WordPress plugin
version. At times, a system integrator might want to migrate the existing
tables to a set of backup tables for safekeeping. This migration tool is
perfect for that.</p><?php img("01") ?>

<p>The tool runs pretty much unattended after you enter the new prefix and
hit the "Migrate Data" button.</p>
